# Introduction to Python

Introduction to Python workshop for DSRI 2025

Python is a powerful and versatile programming language used widely for data analysis, web development, machine learning, and more. In this workshop, we’ll explore the basics of Python programming by analyzing metadata about novels – titles, authors, publication years, languages, genres, and more. We’ll work with both numerical and textual data, learning how to clean, organize, and analyze information using Python. We’ll then shift our focus toward textual analysis exploring patterns and word frequencies across individual novels. Finally, we’ll discuss how to visualize and communicate our findings in accessible and compelling ways.

## About the dataset

[Top 500 'Greatest' Novels (1021-2015)](https://www.responsible-datasets-in-context.com/posts/top-500-novels/top-500-novels.html)

We'll be exploring a dataset focused on the 500 novels most widely held by OCLC libraries, compiled and curated by Anna Preus and Aashna Sheth as part of the [Responsible Datasets in Context](https://www.responsible-datasets-in-context.com/) project. It features titles, bibliographic metadata, author demographic information, as well as OCLC holdings, GoodReads data, and Wikipedia and Project Gutenberg urls. We encourage you to read their [data essay](https://www.responsible-datasets-in-context.com/posts/top-500-novels/top-500-novels.html) explaining the methodology, decisions, bias, and highlights.
